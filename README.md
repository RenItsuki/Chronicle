# Chronicle

**Nothing is erased. Everything evolves.**

Chronicle is a history-first knowledge platform where ideas are not overwritten or deleted.  
Instead, every statement is versioned so users can see how information changes over time.

Rather than showing only the latest answer, Chronicle preserves:
- corrections
- contradictions
- updates
- evolution of thinking

## Core Idea

Articles are divided into:

- **Context** → normal explanatory text  
- **Claims** → version-controlled statements  

Each claim:
- keeps all versions permanently
- can be supported or challenged
- shows the most supported version as the main view

---

## Current Prototype

Frontend demo built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Working
- Stranger Things themed UI
- Horizontal timeline homepage
- Article page with highlighted claims
- Version popup
- Support & Challenge buttons

### Limitations
- Only **one article (COVID)** is implemented
- Timeline links open the same demo page
- Navbar is incomplete
- No backend or database yet
- No persistent storage

This is a **concept prototype**, not a full product.
